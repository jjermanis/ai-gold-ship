version 1	15 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		19 minutes total

Notes v1: As usual, I went for a basic version. Definitely not a finished product. Primary motives
were to test use of Japanese language. The announcer would speak without an effort from me.
When writing in Japanese, and I specific kanji or katakana, it would follow that. The grass race
track had a nice effort. Horse would run from right-to-left, as designed. In the Chrome browser,
you can switch to English - interesting to see. Much more to do!

Not keeping track of TODOs yet. Far from the base game.


version 2	14 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	5 minutes test		40 minutes total

Notes v2: I would say that this is the very basic version of the game. It is by no means complete.
But it has the mechanism for a horse race.  Created a target speed for each horse. They all have a
starting speed (5). There are controls added for Player 1 and 2. 
In its initial version, the game did not appear to start. I mean, maybe it did start, but there was
no motion at all. I asked for the button to be put back. The motion now worked.
There are many changes to make to get to a playable version of the game. But now I think it's
trackable. LOTS to do, but trackable.

This is where I added the TODO list.


version 3	21 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	4 minutes test		1 hour 7 total

Notes v3: This had two defects to fix. First, whatever speed a horse got to in a race, THAT would
be the starting rate in the next race. At a start, it sets all horses to the intended speed of 5.
Second, the UI allowed ridiculous behavior. If you slowed down enough, it let the horse run
backwards. Likewise, there was no limit on top speed. I might change, but for now, min speed is
0 and max speed is 20. The Start Race (in Japanese) was created by itself from Chat. I liked it -
I added a line to the command to produce it; I asked Chat how to write that line. Finally, the
last items was the most complicated: make the horses look more like horse. I provided a description
of how to design it: like a video game from 1987, size 32x32, the already defined colors. The 
first attempt... not horrible, but not good. I asked it to increase to 48x48, to make sure it
used BOTH the colors (it only used one), and make sure it faces the right way (first one did not).
THAT looks halfway decent. Good enough for now, will move forward.



TODO bug was added. The race marks and ending to early. Quite far from the finish line.
TODO the game needs a starting 
TODO the movement is based on the screen refresh rate via requestAnimationFrame(). Need
	to have something based on timing to get a more predictable screen. Maybe 
	lock the game to 30/60 FPS?
TODO add 2-frame leg animation (Chat says classic NES trick - well said)
TODO better calibrate speeds. Have the speed be something that is accelerated to.
TODO get the speeds right. This seems too fast... maybe?  Calibrate to real life speed.
TODO introduce a longer track with scrolling
TODO introduce specific strategies for Gold Ship and Safe Run
TODO add UI to show selected target speeds and current speed.
TODO add some randomness to acceleration to target speed.
TODO needs to calculate and present win-place-show at end
