version 1	15 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	2 minutes test		19 minutes total

Notes v1: As usual, I went for a basic version. Definitely not a finished product. Primary motives
were to test use of Japanese language. The announcer would speak without an effort from me.
When writing in Japanese, and I specific kanji or katakana, it would follow that. The grass race
track had a nice effort. Horse would run from right-to-left, as designed. In the Chrome browser,
you can switch to English - interesting to see. Much more to do!


Not keeping track of TODOs yet. Far from the base game.


version 2	14 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	5 minutes test		40 minutes total

Notes v2: I would say that this is the very basic version of the game. It is by no means complete.
But it has the mechanism for a horse race.  Created a target speed for each horse. They all have a
starting speed (5). There are controls added for Player 1 and 2. 
In its initial version, the game did not appear to start. I mean, maybe it did start, but there was
no motion at all. I asked for the button to be put back. The motion now worked.
There are many changes to make to get to a playable version of the game. But now I think it's
trackable. LOTS to do, but trackable.


TODO the movement is based on the screen refresh rate via requestAnimationFrame(). Need
	to have something based on timing to get a more predictable screen. Maybe 
	lock the game to 30/60 FPS?
TODO make sure that start button is part of text description. What's there was created
	by Chat - spec it to make sure it remains.
TODO seems like a basic bug. After a race is over, the next race will start at the
	preceding speed.
TODO another (probable) bug. Horse can be controlled to run right. Should be allowed?
TODO better calibrate speeds. Have the speed be something that is accelerated to.
TODO get the speeds right. This seems too fast... maybe?  Calibrate to real life speed.
TODO horses look very abstract. Get them to look a bit more like a horse. 
TODO introduce a longer track with scrolling
TODO introduce specific strategies for Gold Ship and Safe Run
TODO add UI to show selected target speeds and current speed.
TODO add some randomness to acceleration to target speed.
